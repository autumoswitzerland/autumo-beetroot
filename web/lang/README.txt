beetRoot does not localize basic languages, such as the distinction between written 
differences between "de_CH" and "de_DE", which is why there is only one translation 
file for each language. Decide on a variant for a translation.

The subdirectories contain the following translations:

- app/  : Translations for the output of internal application messages such as error messages.
- pw/   : Translations for password validation output.
- tmpl/ : Translations for all HTML templates in the "web/html" directory.

All translation files are in the UTF-8 format.
