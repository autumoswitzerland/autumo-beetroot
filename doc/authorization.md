# User, Roles &amp; Authorization
<div id="top"></div>

With release => 3.0.0 beetRoot uses a simple user-role authorization which can be applied to templates and handlers. Furthermore, you can apply visibility to HTML template fragments
by using additionally actions (template type `index`, `view`, `add`, `edit`) and entities.

**Note**: Roles are translated in the web masks if a language translation exists for these roles. The translations for roles in your translation files `web/lang/lang_*.properties` must begin  with `role.*`, e.g. `role.administrator`.


## Strict Authorization

Strict authorization is applied in handlers:

Overwrite the ```hasAccess-methods```, e.g.: 

```Java
	@Override
	public boolean hasAccess(Session userSession) {
		return userSession.getUserRoles().contains("Administrator") ||
				userSession.getUserRoles().contains("Operator");
	}
```

## Visibility with Authorization Tags

Visibility with authorization tags in HTML templates (roles, entities and actions are case-insensitive):

1. Positive role authorization:

	```
	{$if-role=Administrator:}
	...
	{$endif-role;}
	```

	or more than one role:
	
	```
	{$if-role=Administrator,Operator:}
	...
	{$endif-role;}
	```
	
2. Negative role authorization:

	```
	{$if-!role=Controller:}
	...
	{$endif-!role;}
	```

	or more than one role:
	
	```
	{$if-!role=Controller,Operator:}
	...
	{$endif-!role;}
	```

3. Positive entity authorization:

	```
	{$if-entity=tasks:}
	...
	{$endif-entity;}
	```

	or more than one entity:
	
	```
	{$if-entity=tasks,properties:}
	...
	{$endif-entity;}
	```

4. Negative entity authorization:

	```
	{$if-!entity=products:}
	...
	{$endif-!entity;}
	```

	or more than one entity:
	
	```
	{$if-!entity=products,variants:}
	...
	{$endif-!entity;}
	```

5. Positive action authorization:

	```
	{$if-action=edit:}
	...
	{$endif-action;}
	```

	or more than one entity:
	
	```
	{$if-action=add,edit:}
	...
	{$endif-action;}
	```

6. Negative action authorization:

	```
	{$if-!action=index:}
	...
	{$endif-!action;}
	```

	or more than one entity:
	
	```
	{$if-!action=index,view:}
	...
	{$endif-!action;}
	```

**Note**:

- Negative/positive authorization tags shouldn't be cascaded!
- Different types of authorization tags can be cascaded in the order role -> entity -> action. 

## Authorization Customization

If you need a more sophisticated authorization like a full ACL with groups and workflow authorization roles, we suggest that you use the current role object as a sub-role / workflow authorization role and create another entity that acts as a role group. Then implement the ability to associate the sub-roles with the role group and specify in the handler to 
which authorization granularity you want to grant access to (role group or sub-roles).
