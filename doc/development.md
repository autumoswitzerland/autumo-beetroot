# Developing with beetRoot

1. Clone the repository:

	```NuShell
	git clone https://github.com/autumoswitzerland/autumo-beetroot.git
	```

2. Import the maven project into your favourite development IDE.

3. Start developing/customizing: [autumo beetRoot 3.x - Quickstart Video][video-url].

As much as we love [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), for this project we'll stick with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for now.
The quickstart setup is also effortless and very fast!
