# Release 3.1.0 Migration

Release 3.1.0 is a minor release, but requires some effort as the default translation has been 
changed from translating templates by multiplication in language subdirectories to directly 
translating templates if you want to change the language subdirectory approach. However, 
both methods work in parallel or in combination.

- Web Resources
	- Make a backup of the `web/` directory.
	- Update/copy `web/js`, `web/css` and `web/html` directory; don't overwrite files you have customized!
	- Backup your translations made in the directory `web/lang`.
	- Copy the new subdirectories in `web/lang/` and add your translations again to the new translation files!
	- Use the new translation placeholders ( `{$l.replaceVar}` ) in the HTML templates under `web/html` for your templates and/or add new ones.

- Delete stored user sessions file specified by the `ws_user_sessions` configuration key, usually named `.beetroot-web-sessions`.

- Further adjustments
	- Dialogs have been changed to dynamic CSS/JavaScript dialogs; adjust the confirmation dialogs in `edit.html` and `view-html` views; see existing templates.
